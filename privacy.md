# paper 61: SEMI-SUPERVISED KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER FOR DEEP LEARNING FROM PRIVATE TRAINING DATA

The paper presents a semi-supervised learning approach called Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). It protects the privacy of sensitive training data by training an ensemble of teacher models on disjoint datasets.
These teacher models are then used to train a student model without direct access to the sensitive data, ensuring privacy even against adversaries with access to the student modelâ€™s parameters. The approach is validated with strong privacy guarantees and high utility on benchmark datasets like MNIST and SVHN.
Further authors demonstrate its applicability to deep learning methods without assumptions on the learning algorithm.

## Motivation
The paper addresses the challenge of training machine learning models on sensitive data, such as medical records or personal photographs. ML model often inadvertently memorize and expose private information. The authors aim to develop a method that provides strong privacy guarantees for training data to prevent such unintended disclosures.
